## Kenya Counties Data

This module introduces Counties and SubCounties into your project. It adds the necessary models, controllers and migrations for it to work. As this solution seeks to be as unobtrusive as possible, all the data has been handles using seeds. Therefore, you need to run 
*php artisan migrate 
and 
## php artisan db:seed.

This data is broken down into:
1. Regions
2. Counties 
3. SubCounties
4. Wards
